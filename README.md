# Portfolio - Mohammed Rizwan S

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for checking out my portfolio.

This isn't just a collection of files; it's the digital home for my work as a Full-Stack Engineer. I built this site to do one thing: **showcase my skills in a way that feels premium, polished, and professional.**

I wanted a space that reflects how I code—clean, performant, and user-centric. Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow dev, or just passing through, I hope you enjoy the experience.

## 🚀 Why I Built This
I needed a portfolio that stood out. Templates are great, but they often lack personality. I decided to build this from scratch using **React** and **TypeScript** because I wanted full control over the design system, animations, and performance optimizations.

**Key Goals:**
*   **Performance First:** Fast load times and smooth scrolling (60fps).
*   **Design System:** I stuck to a strict set of CSS variables for colors and spacing to ensure consistency.
*   **Responsive:** It had to look amazing on a phone, tablet, and 4k monitor.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
Here's what makes this thing tick:
*   **React (Vite):** Blazing fast builds and hot reloading.
*   **TypeScript:** Type safety helps me sleep better at night. 😴
*   **Vanilla CSS:** No heavy frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap here (mostly). I wanted to keep the bundle size tiny and show off my CSS fundamentals, using Variables and Flexbox/Grid extensively.
*   **Lucide React:** Beautiful, consistent icons.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running it Locally
If you want to poke around the code or run it on your machine:

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/algophoenix/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Fire it up:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite gives you) and take a look!

## 📂 Project Structure
*   `src/components`: Reusable UI bits like the Navbar and Buttons.
*   `src/sections`: The big blocks of the page (Hero, About, Projects, etc.).
*   `src/assets`: Images and PDFs.
*   `index.css`: Where the design magic (variables & global styles) lives.

## 📬 Let's Connect
I'm always open to discussing new opportunities, interesting projects, or just chatting about Java vs. everything else.
